## Usage

Download the source code [here](https://github.com/pi-etro/foxter/archive/main.zip) and compile it with JDK 8:

```bash
javac Servidor.java Peer.java
```

Launch the server on one terminal with `java Servidor` and enter the IP `127.0.0.1`. Once the server is online, peers can join the network to register their ip, port and files and to search for files on other peers.

Launch the peer with `java Peer`, enter the IP `127.0.0.1`, a port number and the absolute path of the folder with the files to be shared.

After the peer has joined and searched for a file present on other peer, the option to download the file directly from this peer is enabled.

To leave the network, the peer can select the `LEAVE` option or close the terminal (the server automatically detects that this peer is now offline and clears its data).

## System design

The server (Servidor) has two main tasks: handle various peer requests and responses and periodically check if each peer is online (Alive).

</p>

The peer has three tasks: handle multiple peers download requisitions, handle Alive control messages or responses from the server and execute the selected menu tasks (`JOIN`, `SEARCH`, `DOWNLOAD` or `LEAVE`).

This system can transfer large files (up to GB files were tested) between peers, this was achieved by sending small 1 KB "packages" until EOF (end-of-file).
